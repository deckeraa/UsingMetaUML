This repository was created to experiment with MetaUML in Latex.
Hopefully I will end up with some working examples and Makefiles to go with them.
I will also use this README as a running log of the project.

I'm following a blog 
post at ````http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~gwiener/software-engineering/how-to-embed-uml-in-latex/````.
Based off its instructions, I got a basic UML example working.
It is in the folder ./example.

Next I attempted to do Lab 2 of SE 2730
````http://www.uwplatt.edu/csse/courses/se273/labs/lab2/```` using 
MetaUML instead of Rational Rose.
These files are in ./lab2.
