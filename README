This repository was created to experiment with MetaUML in Latex.
Hopefully I will end up with some working examples and Makefiles to go with them.
I will also use this README as a running log of the project.

I'm following a blog 
post at ````http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~gwiener/software-engineering/how-to-embed-uml-in-latex/````.
Based off its instructions, I got a basic UML example working.
It is in the folder ./example.
