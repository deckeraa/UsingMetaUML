This repository was created to experiment with MetaUML in Latex.
Hopefully I will end up with some working examples and Makefiles to go with them.
I will also use this README as a running log of the project.

I'm following a blog post at 
http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~gwiener/software-engineering/how-to-embed-uml-in-latex/.
Based off its instructions, I got a basic UML example working.
It is in the folder ./example.

Next I will attempt to do Lab 2 of SE 2730
http://www.uwplatt.edu/csse/courses/se273/labs/lab2/
using MetaUML instead of Rational Rose.
These files are in ./lab2.

I have now finished the Lab 2 diagram of the library system.

Having to place elements by hand seems sort of tedious.
I am going to try to alleviate this somewhat by using relative positioning.
As an experiment, I will try to go from nothing to a finished diagram in the
least amount of time possible.
I wrote a small script to do all the file setup and Makefile generation for me.

Starting at 9:41.
Finishing at 9:58.

That's 18 minutes from start to finish with four actors and four use cases.
While definitely not as fast as I would like, I think that that time is comparable to
what I spent on this same diagram yesterday using Rational Rose.
Most of the time is spent thinking about the diagram and not typing (or clicking, in the case of Rational Rose).
I worry somewhat about program complexity and maintainability with the positioning.
What would be nice is a system where one defined the associations and the system auto-routed everything.
I may have to give more thought to that in the future.
